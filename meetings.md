# {octicon}`people` OGGM Open Meetings

We regularly hold two types of open meetings online within the OGGM community. **Check-in meetings** are held every second Wednesday on Zoom, and the invites are sent via Slack (reach out if you’d like to join). These meetings are a great way to stay updated on what’s happening, ask questions, and discuss work in progress.

In addition, we organize ad-hoc **“Science Cafés”**. These are more focused discussions on specific topics, such as reviewing an article or featuring (invited) presentations on subjects relevant to the community. Both types of meetings are open to anyone!

Currently, the meetings take place from 16:00 to 17:00 CET/CEST, but this time can be adjusted. A Google Calendar has been set up with these regular times (GCAL / ICAL). The OGGM Science Cafés are only held when there is content, so suggestions are very welcome.
