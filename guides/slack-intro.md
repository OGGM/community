# Welcome to the OGGM Slack!
**A little introduction**

The OGGM Slack is our platform for all communication related to OGGM
and its various related projects. We aim for this forum to be an inclusive 
and friendly environment, that is more personal than
an open forum where everyone can read and write.

But what is it about? 

We use Slack to get support, to chat amongst other glacier fans, 
and to stay updated about what happens in the community. With topics 
ranging from _how to solve this error in my code_ and 
_has someone done this already_ to 
_who is going to this meeting/conference and would like to get a coffee_
and plenty more... In short, slack can contribute 
to a sense of being part of the community.

## Practicalities

### Finding your way on the different channels

Slack uses "channels", which are chat groups dedicated to selected topics. 
Everyone is in the `#general` channel, that is used sparingly for general
announcements useful to everyone. The`#general` channel is also 
where the invitations to our fortnightly meetings are announced. The 
`#support` channel is often the best place to ask questions, and 
`#random` is being used for chitchat, from pet pictures to nerdy jokes.

Aside from those channels that most people follow, there are 
many thematic channels that one can join based on interest. 
`#tidewater`, `#surface-mass-balance`, 
`#hardcore-programming` and `#oggm-edu` are some examples . 

Aside from the channels, slack can also be used to chat privately to one or more people 
at the same time. You can chat or "huddle", which is like a phone call with or without 
camera.  

### Good practices

Being a platform with 200+ members, requires some rules 
(see [code of conduct](https://community.oggm.org/code-of-conduct.html)) 
and good practises to keep the platform functioning as intended. 

To keep things organised, a response to a message is always posted 
in a thread. A "thread" is a discussion originating from a post 
and is started as a reply on the original message.

When asking a question in the `#support` channel, please only ask one question at a time 
and phrase it well. With "phrasing it well", I explicitly don't mean your english needs to be perfect. 
However the question needs to be answerable, meaning it needs to include enough context so one 
can understand the issue. For a more ellobarate explanation on how to deal with OGGM related error and 
questions, it's advised to read the brief error guide.

Once your question has been answered, (hopefully) in
the thread bellow, it would be great if you could add a check mark 
to the main question, using e.g. the ✅ emoji (you will see what I mean when 
scrolling through the `#support` channel), so that the others 
know the question has been answered and won't loose time reading 
the whole thread when offering their help. 

## Meeting online

Everyone on our slack is very welcome to join the 
once-every-two-weeks-meetings, no matter your background or 
plans with OGGM. It is quite an informal meeting, so no reason to 
be nervous about joining it. Having said that, it might be more 
interesting to those actively planning to use/using and develop the 
model, than those who don’t. Either way, 
it might be nice to join the meeting, so you will be able to 
meet some of the active members. In fact it is encouraged for new 
member to join the meeting at least once, so you're no longer 
"just a name" to them. For the schedule you can checkout the 
[calendar](https://community.oggm.org/meetings.html).

## How to join?

Slack can be accessed through the browser and via a local 
installation. My personal preference is using the app, and I 
think that is the case for most frequent users.

If you’re interested in joining the OGGM Slack, please send an 
e-mail to [info@oggm.org](mailto:info@oggm.org), stating shortly 
who you are and why you would like to join our slack.
