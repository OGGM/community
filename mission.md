```{epigraph}
The [OGGM](https://oggm.org) community is a collaborative, open-source initiative focused on advancing glacier science and understanding the impacts of climate change on glaciers. Our mission is to provide accessible and comprehensive glacier modeling tools for researchers, educators, and decision-makers. Together, we are building a community-driven platform that enables:

- Cutting-edge glacier and climate science.
- Open educational resources to train the next generation of scientists.
- Public awareness of the importance of glaciers in our changing climate.

We are passionate about supporting open science, providing high-quality data, and encouraging innovative uses of our tools. The OGGM community operates with a spirit of openness and collaboration, recognizing that the best scientific progress is made together.
