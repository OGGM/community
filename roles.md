The purpose of the steering committee is to guide the evolution of OGGM in alignment with its long-term mission and vision, ensuring that the project remains relevant, impactful, and that its online spaces remain safe for everyone.

Steering committee members meet every three months to oversee the governance of OGGM, track ongoing large projects, and ensure activities are conducted in line with the community's mission and values. Ideally, the steering committee members should reflect the community interests: users, developpers, educators, etc. The OGGM steering committee also intervenes in case of internal conflicts or violations of the code of conduct.
