# {octicon}`people` Mission and roles

The OGGM community is a collaborative, open-source initiative focused on advancing glacier science and understanding the impacts of climate change on glaciers. We aim to provide researchers, educators, and decision-makers with accessible and comprehensive glacier modeling tools that promote research, learning, and informed decision-making. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment, where contributors from diverse backgrounds work together to advance our understanding of glaciers.

## Mission statement

> Our mission is to make large scale glacier modeling accessible, transparent, and reliable. By bringing together researchers, developers, and educators, we create a community-driven platform that enables:
>
> - Cutting-edge glacier and climate science.
> - Open educational resources to train the next generation of scientists.
> - Public awareness of the importance of glaciers in our changing climate.
>
> We are passionate about supporting open science, providing high-quality data, and encouraging innovative uses of our tools. The OGGM community operates with a spirit of openness and collaboration, recognizing that the best scientific progress is made together.

## Roles within the OGGM Community

The OGGM community thrives because of the collective effort of many dedicated volunteers. Below, we outline some of the key roles that members of the community take on, ensuring that their contributions are acknowledged.

````{card} Steering committee

The purpose of the steering committee is to guide the evolution of OGGM in alignment with its long-term mission and vision, ensuring that the project remains relevant, impactful, and that its online spaces remain safe for everyone.

Steering committee members meet every three months to oversee the governance of OGGM, track ongoing large projects, and ensure activities are conducted in line with the community's mission and values. Ideally, the steering committee members should reflect the community interests: users, developpers, educators, etc. The OGGM steering committee also intervenes in case of internal conflicts or violations of the code of conduct.
