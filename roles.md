# {octicon}`people` Mission and roles

The OGGM community is a collaborative, open-source initiative focused on advancing glacier science and understanding the impacts of climate change on glaciers. We aim to provide researchers, educators, and decision-makers with accessible and comprehensive glacier modeling tools that promote research, learning, and informed decision-making. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment, where contributors from diverse backgrounds work together to advance our understanding of glaciers.
