# {octicon}`people` About us

We are a diverse group of people interested in glacier modelling or glaciology in general. We collaborate on projects and talk about things, in person and online. We share about ongoing projects and developments in and around the OGGM ecosystem. Keeping this community together and welcoming new members requires work and some form of formal organisation - here are the people who help make it all happen!
