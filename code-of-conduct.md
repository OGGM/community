# {octicon}`code-of-conduct` Code of Conduct

üëãüèΩ Welcome to the OGGM community! We‚Äôre excited to have you with us. Please take a moment to read and accept our Code of Conduct, which outlines the values that make our community strong, inclusive, and respectful. We also invite you to review our [Mission Statement](mission) to understand the shared goals and vision that guide us.

## Introduction

We are a collaborative network of people from various background and interests, that seek to advance glacier evolution modelling through open-source and open-science practices as well as online and in-person networking. Openness, diversity and inclusion make our community strong, and want to be very clear about where we stand.

Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic. We encourage participation from diverse backgrounds and want community members to feel secure sharing ideas and plans without fear of idea appropriation or being 'scooped'. This includes respecting intellectual contributions and engaging in discussions that foster collaborative, rather than competitive, progress.

This code and related procedures apply to unacceptable behavior occurring in all community venues, including behavior outside the scope of community activities ‚Äî online and in-person‚Äî as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Community spaces where this code of conduct is in application

This code of conduct applies to all online spaces managed by OGGM and all in-person or online OGGM events. This includes:

- the OGGM Slack space
- all OGGM repositories in the OGGM github organisation
- the OGGM online meetings
- the OGGM in-person workshops
- the OGGM in-person meetings at conferences, etc.

## Expected behaviour

As a member of our open community, we expect all participants to adhere to the following standards of behavior to ensure a positive and inclusive experience for everyone:

- Be respectful and considerate:
  - Treat everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of their level of experience, background, or differences.
  - Consider the impact of your words and actions on others. Constructive criticism is welcome, but it should be delivered respectfully and thoughtfully.
- Be mindful of our community resources:
  - Use community resources, including time, attention, and infrastructure, wisely and respectfully.
  - Report any issues, concerns, or violations of this Code of Conduct promptly to [info@oggm.org](mailto:info@oggm.org).
- Be collaborative, not competitive:
  - When community members share ideas, they do so with the hope of receiving input to strengthen or expand projects collaboratively. All members should feel safe discussing proposals or concepts without fearing unauthorized use, adaptation, or idea appropriation.
  - Respect the intellectual contributions of others by seeking permission before using ideas discussed in community spaces, and be open to collaboration if an idea inspires you.

## Asking questions to the community

One of the strengths of our community is the willingness to help each other! Whether you have questions about OGGM, glacier modeling, or glaciology in general, we encourage open discussions in OGGM spaces. Remember that our members volunteer their time, so please be considerate of everyone‚Äôs availability. Visit our [](guides/index.md) for more information about how to ask questions respectfully.

If you're looking for feedback or collaboration on ideas, clearly state your goals, and be open about how you envision working together. Show respect for others' intellectual contributions by asking for permission before adapting their ideas or suggestions, fostering a culture of trust and mutual support. Let's build on each other's knowledge while ensuring everyone feels valued and acknowledged.

## Unacceptable behavior ‚úãüèº

- No harassment via private messages: Directly messaging individual users, including community developers, with questions or requests for help is not acceptable unless explicitly invited to do so. Repeatedly contacting someone or pressuring them to respond is considered harassment and will not be tolerated.
- Conduct or speech which might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.
- Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
- Do not show disrespect towards others.
- Disrespect towards differences of opinion.
- Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.
- Violence, threats of violence or violent language.
- Unacceptable practices related to research conduct:
  - Any practice leading to research misconduct, such as fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, intellectual property theft, or unauthorized use of another‚Äôs ideas (idea appropriation).
  - Unauthorized use of ideas shared by community members for projects or publications without proper credit or collaboration.

For guidance on research integrity and ethical conduct, refer to [ORI‚Äôs Definition of Research Misconduct](https://ori.hhs.gov/definition-research-misconduct) and the [UKRIO‚Äôs Research Misconduct Guidelines](https://ukrio.org/research-integrity/what-is-research-misconduct/).

## Consequences üëÆüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated in our community.

If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact us via email at [info@oggm.org](mailto:info@oggm.org).
