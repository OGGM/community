# {octicon}`code-of-conduct` Code of Conduct

üëãüèΩ Welcome to the OGGM community! We‚Äôre excited to have you with us. Please take a moment to read and accept our Code of Conduct, which outlines the values that make our community strong, inclusive, and respectful. We also invite you to review our [Mission Statement](mission) to understand the shared goals and vision that guide us.

## Introduction

We are a collaborative network of people from various backgrounds and interests, who seek to advance glacier evolution modelling through open-source and open-science practices as well as online and in-person networking. Openness, collaboration, diversity and inclusion make our community strong. Thus, we want to be clear about how to sustain those values together.

Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of professional experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristics. We encourage participation from diverse backgrounds and want community members to feel secure sharing ideas and plans without fear of idea appropriation or being 'scooped'. This includes respecting intellectual contributions and engaging in discussions that foster collaborative, rather than competitive, progress.

## Community spaces where this code of conduct is in application

This code of conduct applies to all online spaces managed by OGGM, all in-person or online OGGM events, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members as well as their career develpment. This includes:

- the OGGM Slack space
- all OGGM repositories in the OGGM github organisation
- the OGGM online meetings
- the OGGM in-person workshops
- the OGGM in-person meetings at conferences, etc.

## Rules of scientific collaboration in an open source community

### Our metrics of success

The OGGM ecosystem is developed using time secured through selective job opportunities and competitive grant proposals by scientific researchers, who commonly prioritize three primary metrics of success:

- Achieving scientific and societal impact.
- Publishing articles in peer-reviewed journals.
- Gathering funding to support their research activities.

### Open source takes time

We proudly share the OGGM software and data under an open-source license, recognizing that:

- Making code truly open-source demands time and dedication.
- Sharing our methods openly in real-time exposes our latest ideas to colleagues and competitors alike.
- Open-source development is an everyday dilemma opposing our metrics of success and our service to teh community.

### What we expect from members of the community

To help ensure sustainable development of OGGM, our expectations follow three principles:

1. Open source does not mean free support, please be respectful of the developpers own needs when reaching out to them.
2. If you find our software helpful, consider collaborating with us so we can advance science together.
3. Help us help you, please consider the many ways you can help us achieve our three metrics of success above, together.

## Expected behaviour

As a member of our open community, we expect all participants to adhere to the following standards of behavior to ensure a positive and inclusive experience for everyone:

- Be respectful and considerate:
  - Treat everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of their level of experience, background, or differences.
  - Consider the impact of your words and actions on others. Constructive criticism is welcome, but it should be delivered respectfully and thoughtfully.
- Be collaborative, not competitive:
  - When community members share ideas, they do so with the hope of receiving input to strengthen or expand projects collaboratively. All members should feel safe discussing proposals or concepts without fearing unauthorized use, adaptation, or idea appropriation.
  - Respect the intellectual contributions of others by seeking permission before using ideas discussed in community spaces, and be open to collaboration if an idea inspires you.
- Be mindful of our community resources:
  - Use community resources wisely and respectfully.  Be mindful of time, attention, and infrastructure.
  - Report any issues, concerns, or violations of this Code of Conduct promptly to [info@oggm.org](mailto:info@oggm.org).

## Asking questions to the community

One of the strengths of our community is our willingness to help each other! Whether you have questions about OGGM, glacier modeling, or glaciology in general, we encourage open discussions in OGGM spaces. Remember that our members volunteer their time, so please be considerate of everyone‚Äôs availability. Visit our [](guides/index.md) for more information about how to ask questions effectively.

If you're looking for feedback or collaboration on ideas, clearly state your goals, and be open about how you envision working together.

## Unacceptable behavior ‚úãüèº

- No harassment via private messages: Directly messaging individual users, including community developers, with questions or requests for help is not acceptable unless explicitly invited to do so. Repeatedly contacting someone or pressuring them to respond is considered harassment and will not be tolerated.
- Do not behave or speak in ways that might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.
- Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
- Do not show disrespect towards others.
- Do not show disrespect towards differences of opinion.
- No inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.
- No violence, threats of violence or violent language.
- No research misconduct:
  - No fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, intellectual property theft, etc.
  - No unauthorized use of ideas shared by community members for projects or publications without proper credit or collaboration.

For guidance on research integrity and ethical conduct, see the [UKRIO‚Äôs Research Misconduct Guidelines](https://ukrio.org/research-integrity/what-is-research-misconduct/). Our project adheres to the [Turing Way Guide for Ethical Research](https://book.the-turing-way.org).

## Consequences ‚öñÔ∏è

Unacceptable behavior and research misconduct will not be tolerated in our community. If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact us via email at [info@oggm.org](mailto:info@oggm.org).

In response to violations, the OGGM [steering committee](roles.md) will take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all OGGM spaces and events.
