# {octicon}`code-of-conduct` Code of Conduct

👋🏽 Welcome to the OGGM community! We’re excited to have you with us. Please take a moment to read and accept our Code of Conduct, which outlines the values that make our community strong, inclusive, and respectful. We also invite you to review our [Mission Statement](mission) to understand the shared goals and vision that guide us.

## Introduction

We are a collaborative network of people from various backgrounds and interests, who seek to advance glacier evolution modelling through open-source and open-science practices as well as online and in-person networking. Openness, diversity and inclusion make our community strong. Thus, we want to be clear about how to sustain those values together.

Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of professional experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristics. We encourage participation from diverse backgrounds and want community members to feel secure sharing ideas and plans without fear of idea appropriation or being 'scooped'. This includes respecting intellectual contributions and engaging in discussions that foster collaborative, rather than competitive, progress.

This code and related procedures apply to behavior occurring in all community venues, including behavior outside of formal community activities — online and in-person — as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Community spaces where this code of conduct is in application

This code of conduct applies to all online spaces managed by OGGM and all in-person or online OGGM events. This includes:

- the OGGM Slack space
- all OGGM repositories in the OGGM github organisation
- the OGGM online meetings
- the OGGM in-person workshops
- the OGGM in-person meetings at conferences, etc.

## Expected behaviour

As a member of our open community, we expect all participants to adhere to the following standards of behavior to ensure a positive and inclusive experience for everyone:

- Be respectful and considerate:
  - Treat everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of their level of experience, background, or differences.
  - Consider the impact of your words and actions on others. Constructive criticism is welcome, but it should be delivered respectfully and thoughtfully.
- Be collaborative, not competitive:
  - When community members share ideas, they do so with the hope of receiving input to strengthen or expand projects collaboratively. All members should feel safe discussing proposals or concepts without fearing unauthorized use, adaptation, or idea appropriation.
  - Respect the intellectual contributions of others by seeking permission before using ideas discussed in community spaces, and be open to collaboration if an idea inspires you.
- Be mindful of our community resources:
  - Use community resources wisely and respectfully.  Be mindful of time, attention, and infrastructure.
  - Report any issues, concerns, or violations of this Code of Conduct promptly to [info@oggm.org](mailto:info@oggm.org).

## Asking questions to the community

One of the strengths of our community is our willingness to help each other! Whether you have questions about OGGM, glacier modeling, or glaciology in general, we encourage open discussions in OGGM spaces. Remember that our members volunteer their time, so please be considerate of everyone’s availability. Visit our [](guides/index.md) for more information about how to ask questions effectively.

If you're looking for feedback or collaboration on ideas, clearly state your goals, and be open about how you envision working together.

## Unacceptable behavior ✋🏼

- No harassment via private messages: Directly messaging individual users, including community developers, with questions or requests for help is not acceptable unless explicitly invited to do so. Repeatedly contacting someone or pressuring them to respond is considered harassment and will not be tolerated.
- Do not behave or speak in ways that might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.
- Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
- Do not show disrespect towards others.
- Do not show disrespect towards differences of opinion.
- No inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.
- No violence, threats of violence or violent language.
- No research misconduct:
  - No fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, intellectual property theft, etc.
  - No unauthorized use of ideas shared by community members for projects or publications without proper credit or collaboration.
