# OGGM Community Code of Conduct

:wave: Welcome to the OGGM community, please make sure you **read and accept** the following code of conduct when joining our community.

## Introduction

We are a collaborative network of people from various background and interests, that seek to advance glacier evolution modelling through open-source and open-science practices as well as online and in-person networking. We aim our community to be inclusive and accessible to a diverse population of users and learners.

Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.

Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic.

This code and related procedures apply to unacceptable behavior occurring in all community venues, including behavior outside the scope of community activities — online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Community spaces where this code of conduct is in application

This code of conduct applies to all online spaces managed by OGGM and all in-person or online OGGM events. This includes:

- the OGGM Slack space
- all OGGM repositories in the OGGM github organisation
- the OGGM online meetings
- the OGGM in-person workshops
- the OGGM in-person meetings at conferences, etc.

## Expected Behaviour

As a member of our open community, we expect all participants to adhere to the following standards of behavior to ensure a positive and inclusive experience for everyone:

- Be respectful and considerate:
  - Treat everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of their level of experience, background, or differences.
  - Consider the impact of your words and actions on others. Constructive criticism is welcome, but it should be delivered respectfully and thoughtfully.

- Be mindful of our community resources:
  - Use community resources, including time, attention, and infrastructure, wisely and respectfully.
  - Report any issues, concerns, or violations of this Code of Conduct promptly to [info@oggm.org](mailto:info@oggm.org).

## Guidance regarging asking questions to the community

A major role of our community is to help each other out! It's totally fine and even expected to ask questions about OGGM (or glacier modelling and glaciology in general) in the OGGM spaces. However, be mindful of everyone's time: we are all volunteers!

### OGGM documentation and tutorials

We highly encourage all users, especially those who are new to OGGM, to thoroughly read the [documentation](https://docs.oggm.org) and [tutorials](https://tutorials.oggm.org/master/notebooks/welcome.html) provided. These resources are designed to help you understand core features and gain a comprehensive understanding of the software's functionality and capabilities.

### How to ask a question, ask for help or report an issue

Quickly find solutions to common issues and learn best practices for using the software effectively by reading:

1. [Dealing with errors after a run](https://tutorials.oggm.org/master/notebooks/tutorials/deal_with_errors.html)
2. [Help! I have an error guide]([guides/error-guide.md]).

### How to ask for help on slack?

We have a designated `#support` channel which should be use if you have read the above, tried everything else stated in the previous post and don't know what else to do.

When seeking help with `error troubleshooting` in our slack `#support` channel, it's important to provide clear, concise, and detailed information. This helps others understand your problem quickly and offer effective solutions.

Here's a guide on how to structure your request for help:

1. Clear Title.

> Example: Help Error 'XYZ' When Running [Software Name/Version] on [Operating System].

2. Brief Description: Start with a brief summary of the issue.

> Example: "I'm encountering an issue when trying to run [software/tool]. The error message reads 'XYZ', and it occurs every time I try to [describe the action]."

3. Provide Context.
- Software Version: Mention the exact version of the software you are using.
- Operating System: Specify your OS and version (e.g., Windows 10, macOS Big Sur, Ubuntu 20.04).
- Environment: If relevant, mention the programming language, framework, or environment (e.g., Python 3.8, OGGM version xx).

4. Share the Error Message:
    Copy and paste the exact error message or code output. **Copy and highlight the most relevant part of the error if it’s long.**

5. Describe what you’ve tried.
    List the steps you’ve already taken to resolve the issue.
Mention any research or troubleshooting efforts.
> Example: "I tried reinstalling the software and checking my configuration files. I also searched online but couldn't find a solution that works for this specific case."
>

6. Provide Code or Configuration Snippets
- If the error is related to code, share a minimal, reproducible example.
- Use [code formatting](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/collaboration/designing-and-formatting-messages-in-slack#:~:text=When%20you're%20writing%20a,make%20key%20excerpts%20stand%20out.) to make it readable.

> Example use "``" around a word that is related to the code and it will look `like this`

- See a good example of how to raise an error in the support channel
> Hello, has anyone else had issues with the netcdf related tasks (particularly tasks.gridded_attributes ) raising this error:
`OSError; [Errno -101] NetCDF: HDF error`? It seems like some kind of file locking issue from what I've read online, but it does not always happen, so I am a bit puzzled.

### Raising an issue in the [OGGM Github](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/issues)

If you are working on code development or encounter a bug in the codebase, raising an issue on GitHub in one of the OGGM repositories may be more appropriate.

See the following [guide to write a good Github issue](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Good-GitHub-Issues.md)

**Finally** taking the time to read through the documentation and tutorials will significantly enhance your experience and ensure you get the most out of our pool of tools :hammer:.

## Unacceptable Behavior :male-police-officer:

- No harassment via private messages: Directly messaging individual users, including community developers, with questions or requests for help is not acceptable unless explicitly invited to do so. Repeatedly contacting someone or pressuring them to respond is considered harassment and will not be tolerated.
- Conduct or speech which might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.
- Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
- Do not show disrespect towards others.
- Disrespect towards differences of opinion.
- Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.
- Violence, threats of violence or violent language.

## Enforcement :female-police-officer:

Understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated in our community.

If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact us via email at [info@oggm.org](mailto:info@oggm.org).

If violations occur, the OGGM steering committee will take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all OGGM spaces and events.
