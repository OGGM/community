# {octicon}`code-of-conduct` Code of Conduct

üëãüèΩ Welcome to the OGGM community, please make sure you **read and accept** the following code of conduct when joining our community.

## Introduction

We are a collaborative network of people from various background and interests, that seek to advance glacier evolution modelling through open-source and open-science practices as well as online and in-person networking. We aim our community to be inclusive and accessible to a diverse population of users and learners.

Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.

Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic.

This code and related procedures apply to unacceptable behavior occurring in all community venues, including behavior outside the scope of community activities ‚Äî online and in-person‚Äî as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Community spaces where this code of conduct is in application

This code of conduct applies to all online spaces managed by OGGM and all in-person or online OGGM events. This includes:

- the OGGM Slack space
- all OGGM repositories in the OGGM github organisation
- the OGGM online meetings
- the OGGM in-person workshops
- the OGGM in-person meetings at conferences, etc.

## Expected behaviour

As a member of our open community, we expect all participants to adhere to the following standards of behavior to ensure a positive and inclusive experience for everyone:

- Be respectful and considerate:
  - Treat everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of their level of experience, background, or differences.
  - Consider the impact of your words and actions on others. Constructive criticism is welcome, but it should be delivered respectfully and thoughtfully.

- Be mindful of our community resources:
  - Use community resources, including time, attention, and infrastructure, wisely and respectfully.
  - Report any issues, concerns, or violations of this Code of Conduct promptly to [info@oggm.org](mailto:info@oggm.org).

## Asking questions to the community

A major role of our community is to help each other out! It's totally fine and even expected to ask questions about OGGM (or glacier modelling and glaciology in general) in the OGGM spaces. However, be mindful of everyone's time: we are all volunteers!

Visit our [](guides/index.md) for more information about how to ask questions respectfully.

## Unacceptable behavior ‚úãüèº

- No harassment via private messages: Directly messaging individual users, including community developers, with questions or requests for help is not acceptable unless explicitly invited to do so. Repeatedly contacting someone or pressuring them to respond is considered harassment and will not be tolerated.
- Conduct or speech which might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.
- Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
- Do not show disrespect towards others.
- Disrespect towards differences of opinion.
- Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.
- Violence, threats of violence or violent language.

## Consequences üëÆüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated in our community.

If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact us via email at [info@oggm.org](mailto:info@oggm.org).

If violations occur, the OGGM steering committee will take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all OGGM spaces and events.
